There's not much here yet, but hopefully there'll be more soon :)

Have a look at my (food) [recipes for people with low to zero energy](recipes).

Why not have a read through my [repos](https://github.com/Septolum) and see if they're of any use to you?

Or perhaps my [greasemonkey scripts](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/168023-septolum) may interest you?

And if that doesn't take your fancy how about a game of [pong](pong.html), made by me! (Warning, unmaintained, old, inexperienced, dubious code at best)
